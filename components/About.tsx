    <p>
      Hi, welcome to my corner of the Internet! I&apos;m a graduate from the
      University of Waterloo, Canada where I studied Mathematics and Accounting.
      I am interested in using the power of data and software to solve real
      business problems. I started out as a huge Excel nerd, but I&apos;ve
      gradually broadened my skillset to address the complexity and size of
      today&apos;s business problems. In my spare time, I work on side projects,
      try to pick up more technical skills, watch basketball, poorly attempt to
      play basketball, and take walks.
