    <p>
      &quot;Pdflow&quot; is a low-code solution to extract text from PDF files.
      When I was a Staff Accountant at KPMG, I built several VBA programs that
      involved reading text from PDF documents (partnership returns, corporate
      documents, etc.); I finally decided to build a tool that would help
      simplify the process of building the extraction sequence itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web app for Pdflow is built using MeteorJS + React. AWS Lambda is used
      to partition large extraction jobs. Text extraction is performed via the
      Tesseract OCR Engine. Image pre-processing (grayscale, otsu threshold) is
      used to improve the accuracy of the extraction. Developers can also
      utilize the Pdflow API to integrate flows into their own apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pdflow has over 50 users consisting of students, educators, business
      owners and civic data analysts. Although Stripe integration is included in
      the app, my users seem more than happy making use of my generous free tier
      ðŸ¥².

      &quot;Gourd&quot; was built by me as an internal ERP for our start-up,
      Intelline, before transitioning to Quickbooks. While most sane people
      would have started with an existing ERP to run their business, I was
      determined to improve my web dev skills while building an useful, tailored
      internal tool for our company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gourd includes modules for: recording/tracking tasks, expenditure
      management, accounting and budgeting. It also has integrations with
      Tableau (analysis) and Google Drive (uploading/downloading supporting
      documentation).
