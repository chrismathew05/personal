      &quot;Pdflow&quot; is a low-code solution to extract text from PDF files.
      When I was a Staff Accountant at KPMG, I built several VBA programs that
      involved reading text from PDF documents (partnership returns, corporate
      documents, etc.); I finally decided to build a tool that would help
      simplify the process of building the extraction sequence itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web app for Pdflow is built using MeteorJS + React. AWS Lambda is used
      to partition large extraction jobs. Text extraction is performed via the
      Tesseract OCR Engine. Image pre-processing (grayscale, otsu threshold) is
      used to improve the accuracy of the extraction. Developers can also
      utilize the Pdflow API to integrate flows into their own apps. To
      accomodate Tesseract, I built a Docker image which gets uploaded to AWS
      ECR and then deployed to Lambda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pdflow has over 50 users consisting of students, educators, business
      owners and civic data analysts. Although Stripe integration is included in
      the app, my users seem more than happy making use of my generous free tier
      ðŸ¥².

      &quot;Gourd&quot; was built by me as an internal ERP system for our
      start-up, Intelline, before transitioning to Quickbooks. While most sane
      people would have used an existing ERP application to run their business,
      I was determined to improve my web dev skills while building an useful,
      tailored internal tool for our company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gourd includes modules for: recording/tracking tasks, expenditure
      management, accounting and budgeting. It also has integrations with
      Tableau (analysis) and Google Drive (uploading/downloading supporting
      documentation).

      I started this project with my friend{" "}

      after listening to a lecture at UW about stock price reactions to earnings
      releases. This project scrapes various sources (Yahoo Finance, Tipranks,
      Questrade, etc.) and tracks daily/intraday metrics on many stocks from the
      following markets: CSE, TSX, TSXV, NASDAQ, NYSE. A scoring algorithm is
      continuously run, sending us notifications of what to buy/sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scoring algorithm is quite naive at the moment. I am considering using
      a supervised learning algorithm (likely an ensemble) to help build a model
      between the metrics I track and stock performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As this is a private project, I am limited in what I can share. Below is
      an architecture chart to give you an idea about how it works; I have also
      provided links to a repo with a very small section of the source code and
      a cropped screenshot of our documentation in Sphinx.
